# Student Database (E)

## This is an exercise and is related to HW05 and HW06.

<strong>Please read the entire file before you ask any question.</strong><br>
<strong>You should write your own Makefile to test the code.</strong>

In this exercise, you will learn to connect, close, and search information in a database of students. The database is a text file containing six columns: id, name, major, year, enrollment, and age. A few lines of the database are shown below:
	1,Albany,ABE,Freshman,No,20<br>
	2,Karsyn,IE,Freshman,No,18<br>
	3,Jazmina,CS,Junior,Yes,18<br>
	4,Jalayla,BME,Junior,Yes,21<br>
	5,Hanya,ME,Freshman,Yes,20<br>
	6,Rudy,ME,Freshman,No,21

# Learning Goals
You will learn to
* Define a structure needed.
* Allocate and release memory.
* Read text file.
* Use argc and argv correctly in main.


# Functions you need to complete
In this exercise, you have to complete three functions - `Connect()`, `Close()`, `SearchByName()` in `pe04.c`, `main()` in `main.c`, and define `Student` structure in the `pe04.h` file.

1. `Connect()` - Read the content in the file and allocate appropriate memory to store the content. This function accepts only one argument:
	1. filename: the filename of the database you are going to connect.
	2. You may want to use: `fopen()`, `fclose()`, `fscanf()`, `feof()` to read the file content.
	3. This function returns a pointer to `StudentDatabase` object. 
	4. If you fail to connect to the database, you should return NULL.
2. `Close()` - This function releases the memory you allocated in `Connect()` and close the database. Not completing this function will lead to memory leak. This function has one argument:
	1. studb: the pointer to `StudentDatabase` object of which the memory needs to be freed.   
3. `SearchByName()` - This function searches the student by name in database. It accepts two arguments:
	1. studb: the pointer to `StudentDatabase` object where you will search for the student.
	2. name: the name of the student you are looking for.
	3. This function should return a `NULL` if the name is not in the database, otherwise it should return a pointer to the `Student` structure which stores all the info of that student. 
4. `main()` - In this exercise, you will learn to use `argc` and `argv`. Here are the specifications.
	1. `argc`: If `argc` is less than 3, you should return `EXIT_FAILURE` and print "Insufficient arguments\n".
	2. `argv[1]`: name of the input file.
	3. `argv[2]`: should be either "-a", or "-s".
 			When `argv[2]` is "-a", you should print all the students in database using `PrintDatabase()` function and return `EXIT_SUCCESS`.
 			When `argv[2]` is "-s', you should  enter the name of the student in `argv[3]` and print information of that student, if there is no input in `argv[3]` you should print "Wrong arguments\n" and return `EXIT_FAILURE`.
			If `argv[2]` is neither "-a" nor "-s", you should print "Wrong arguments\n" and return `EXIT_FAILURE`
	4. `argv[3]`: We only need input in `argv[3]` when `argv[2]` is equal to "-s". `argv[3]` is the name of the student you are looking for. If there is no such student, you should print "No this student\n". Otherwise, use `PrintStudent()` function to print the information of the student.
5. Define `Student` structure in pe04.h: The `Student` structure has 6 fields, we have deifned 2 of them for you. Complete the remaining 6 fields. See `pe04.h` for further information.

# Testing your code
Following are the files we provide:
1. `pe04.c` - Define your functions in this assignment.
2. `pe04.h` - Header file, which has definition for the functions and structures you need in this assignment.
3. `main.c` - main file of this assignment.
4. `database.txt` - This is the database file which stores all student's info.
5. `output1.txt` - This is an example output when you run `./pe04 database.txt -a`
6. `output2.txt` - This is an example output when you run `./pe04 database.txt -s name`
	Note that this file has multiple lines because we run the command with different names.
7. `output3.txt` - This is an example output when you run `./pe04` with wrong argc or argv arguments. 
	Differnt types of argc, argv errors leads to different output. 


To test your code. You have to first compile it and then run the following command.

Print all student info in database.
```
./pe04 database.txt -a
```
Print the student you are looking for in database.
```
./pe04 database.txt -s name
```
1. pe04 - This is binary that should get generated
2. database.txt - This is the database file which stores all students' information.
3. "-a", "-s" - These are the arguments you should specify. "-a" means to print all the information in the database. "-s" means to print the information of the student you are looking for. 
4. name - name of the student you are looking for. You only have to input this argument when `argv[2]` is "-s".

# Checking for memory errors
You should also run./pe04 with arguments under valgrind. To do that, you have to use, for example, the following command:
```
valgrind --log-file=memcheck.log ./pe04 database.txt -a
```
and
```
valgrind --log-file=memcheck.log ./pe04 database.txt -s name
```
Note that you should use other input arguments to extensively test your function. If you follow the instructions and keep the malloc and free functions in the right place, you should not have memory problems in this assignment.


# Submitting Your code
** This is a programming exercise, so you would have to submit the code on Blackboard.**

You have to submit the following file in a <strong>zip</strong> folder on the blackboard:
* `pe04.c` - This file should have `Connect()`, `Close()`, `SearchByName()` functions completed.
* `pe04.h` - This file should have `Student` structure defined.
* `main.c` - This file should have `main()` function completed.
<strong>You will not get any credits if the submitted file is not zipped</strong>

The **only** way to submit homework is through Blackboard.

The instructor will **never** accept any requestion for exception "*my
submission is only one minute late*".  It is your responsibility to
meet the deadline.  You are strongly encouraged to submit at least ten
minutes before the deadline because submission may take time.

If there is a campus-wide problem (such as network outage or the
Blackboard server is down), the deadline will be extended for the
entire class. If the problem is specific to yourself (for example,
your computer crashes), the deadline will not be extended for
you.

**DO NOT** send your code by email. Your code will not be graded
  if it is sent by email.

The teaching staff is strictly prohibited to look at files on your
computer (or your Purdue account) for grading. Thus, **NEVER** say "I
finished before the deadline but I forgot to submit".  **NEVER** say "I have
not made any change after the submission deadline." because the
teaching staff is not allowed to look at your files that have not been
submitted through Blackboard.

# Grading
If your program has any compilation error or warning (remember to use
`gcc -std=c99 -g -Wall -Wshadow --pedantic -Wvla -Werror`), you will
receive zero in this assignment.

In absolutely no circumstance can the teaching staff modify your
program for grading.  You cannot say, "If you change this, my program
works." If your program misses a semicolon and cannot compile, you
will receive zero.  Your score depends on what is submitted, nothing
else.

This exercise will be graded as folows:
1. `Student` structure: whehter the structure is properly defined.
2. `Connect()` function: whether you successfully connect to database.txt.
3. `Close()` function: whether you release all the allocated memory.
4. `SeachByName()` function: whether your function meets the specification as described above. 
5. `argc` and `argv`: whether the main function meets the specifications as described above.
6.  Code that contains memory problems reportable by Valgrind will be subject to a penalty of 40% of the total possible points.

<strong>Do not print anything other than the required output (i.e., no debugging output, etc.).</strong>
<strong>`ifndef` is used for grading. Please do not change it.</strong>
