## Grading script for HW09
To run the grading script, do the following:
1. Copy `pa09.c`, `main.c` and `read_write.c` files to this location. Don't copy any other files
2. Run the following commands:
```
bash gradescript.sh
```
3. The above command will create `result.txt` inside `result` folder. This will have the output of your code on test cases
4. Your grade reflected through this script might be lower compared to your score reflected on the Blackboard because we tested each of your
code separately.
5. Please check `result.txt` file before emailing any of the teaching staff.
6. If you have one more extra print statement or print statement is wrong, we will not be able to help you.
